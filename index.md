## Overview

Crowdmo is a web application that allows users to create Venmo "crowdfunds"

### Why did I build this web app?

Last year I watched a number of my friends take part in paid fantasy football leagues, a typical buy in was about $10. Some of these leagues had over 30 people, and getting everyone to pay the buy in fee was difficult. Who should I Venmo the buy in fee? How much is the total pot worth? What's the buy in fee? In order to simplify the payment process for these leagues, I built a web app that allowed users to create GoFundMe like campaigns, the only difference being all of the money was transacted through Venmo.
